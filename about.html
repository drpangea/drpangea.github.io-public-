        <h2>The Biblers</h2>
        <p>Loren never got to meet his namesake. Loren E. Bibler (d.1985) was a Naval Officer in World War II. After the war he continued his public service as the Principal of Arlington High School for over 35 years.</p>

        <p>Keith Bibler (d.2014) followed in his father's footsteps, serving in the Korean War. Keith later retired from Marathon Oil with a full pension. Keith was married to Joan Bibler (d.2021) for over 50 years.</p>

        <blockquote>
          “Even being hundreds of miles away, Grandpa and Grandma were able to travel and be a part of our family.” — Loren
        </blockquote>

        <h2>The Manninos</h2>
        <p>Dr. Ernest Mannino (d.2017) was a first‑generation Italian‑American from Watertown, Massachusetts. Dr. Mannino had a decorated public service career: he served as a Navigator in World War II, spent a decade as a school principal, and completed a more than 40‑year career at the U.S. Department of State. In 1985, President Reagan recognized Dr. Mannino with the Distinguished Honor Award, the highest award the Department of State presents to a civilian.</p>

        <blockquote>
          “My grandfather was a window for me to see a time when Washington DC wasn’t as cynical, when people really cared about the work they were able to do.” — Loren
        </blockquote>

        <h2>The Agronomist</h2>
        <p>Loren’s turf career started as many others do: he needed money in high school and wanted to work outside. Loren’s passion was developed through working alongside his father David.</p>

        <blockquote>
          “Let me do it. If it goes wrong, only I can be accountable.” — David Bibler, Father
        </blockquote>

        <p>Loren graduated from NC State with a BA in Political Science and an AS in Turfgrass Management. After graduation, Loren moved to Rockville, Maryland for an Assistant Superintendent position at Woodmont Country Club. While Loren was at Woodmont, the club was named to the top 100 golf courses in America and hosted the 2020 USGA Women’s Amateur.</p>
